== Soldering

If you decide to continue on the path of electronics, learning to solder
if a must. In our case though, we will not focus on this as we are using
solderless board and breadboard to complete our circuits without the
need to solder. Just know that there are many good tutorials on the
internet and that it is not hard, it just requires practice and your
first time might not work, or it might be ugly with 5 times too much
tin. No one paint a perfect portrait on the first try in 5 minutes. Make
sure your first try is not on something you cannot live without.
